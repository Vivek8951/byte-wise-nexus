The top tier of the Tech Learn stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML.

React's strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with minimal code and minimal pain, and it has all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a modern web framework: great support for forms, error handling, events, lists, and more.

#### Why use React?

Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.

JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.

Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.

High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.

### 3.2 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the standard Markup language for creating Web pages and describes the structure of a Web page. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.
