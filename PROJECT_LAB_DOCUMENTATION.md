## Title of the Project
**Tech Learn Platform - AI-Powered Online Learning Management System**

## Abstract

The Tech Learn Platform is a comprehensive online learning management system designed to revolutionize digital education through AI-powered course generation and personalized learning experiences. This web-based application serves as a centralized platform where administrators can create and manage courses while students can enroll, learn, and track their progress through interactive video content, downloadable resources, and AI-generated study materials.

The platform leverages modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, while utilizing Supabase as the backend service for authentication, database management, and serverless functions. The system incorporates artificial intelligence through OpenRouter API integration to automatically generate course content, descriptions, and learning materials, significantly reducing the time and effort required for course creation.

Key features include role-based access control (admin and student roles), real-time course enrollment tracking, certificate generation upon course completion, AI-powered chatbot assistance, and seamless integration with YouTube for educational video content. The platform is designed to be scalable, responsive, and user-friendly, making it suitable for educational institutions, corporate training programs, and individual educators.
